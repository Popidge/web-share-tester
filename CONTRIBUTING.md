- Maintain consistent spacing
- Follow mobile-first responsive design

### File Naming

- Use kebab-case for files: `share-mockups.jsx`
- Use PascalCase for components: `ShareMockup`
- Use camelCase for variables and functions

## Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing

1. **Start both servers** (dev + testing)
2. **Test all platforms** (iOS, Android, macOS, Windows)
3. **Test all share targets** (Messages, Mail, Twitter, WhatsApp)
4. **Test live interception** with the test app
5. **Test responsive design** on different screen sizes
6. **Test WebSocket connections**

### Automated Testing

We welcome contributions to improve our testing:
- Unit tests for utility functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for user workflows
- Performance tests for large datasets

## Platform-Specific Guidelines

### Adding New Platforms

1. **Research the platform's** native share UI
2. **Create accurate mockups** using devices.css or custom CSS
3. **Add platform to** the platforms array in `app.jsx`
4. **Create share dialog component** in `components/ShareMockups.jsx`
5. **Add styling** in `components/ShareMockups.css`
6. **Test thoroughly** on different screen sizes

### Adding New Share Target Apps

1. **Research the app's** interface and typical share handling
2. **Create receiver mockup** in the appropriate app section
3. **Ensure responsive design**
4. **Add to shareTargets** array in `app.jsx`
5. **Test the complete flow** from sender to receiver

## Release Process

Releases are automated through GitHub Actions:

1. **Create a release** on GitHub with a version tag (e.g., `v1.1.0`)
2. **GitHub Actions** will automatically build and publish to npm
3. **Update CHANGELOG.md** with release notes
